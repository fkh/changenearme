Change Near Me (a.k.a. Change In My Backyard) is a mobile-friendly map, to show you projects from ioby.org and Change By Us in NYC. Rather than hunting around a bunch of different sites to find active community projects, pull out your phone and see what's around you.

Data comes via Scraperwiki. The map uses Leaflet. Location via your browser's built-in geolocation.

A few things to fix:
-Put the data into CartoDB, for much easier mapping and spatial queries
-Add user's current location as a marker
-Nicer basemap (needs less stuff going on)
-Deal with city-wide projects in Change By Us  (maybe don't show them?)
-Deal with scraper failure on the ioby projects
-Add pagination, only pulling the first page of changebyus (whoops!)
-Points from Change By Us are all in the same location by neighborhood, need to add some jitter or cluster them.
