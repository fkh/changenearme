Change Near Me (a.k.a. Change In My Backyard) is a mobile-friendly map, to show you projects from ioby.org and Change By Us in NYC. Rather than hunting around a bunch of different sites to find active community projects, pull out your phone and see what's around you. Check it out at http://changenear.me

Data comes via Scraperwiki and CartoDB. The map uses Leaflet. Location via your browser's built-in geolocation.
