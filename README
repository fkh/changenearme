Change Near Me (a.k.a. Change In My Backyard) is a mobile-friendly map, to show you active projects from ioby.org and Change By Us in NYC. 

Data comes via Scraperwiki. The map uses Leaflet. Location via your browers' built-in geolocation.

A few things to fix:
- Add user's current location as a marker
-	Nicer basemap (needs less stuff going on)
-	Deal with city-wide projects in Change By Us  (maybe don't show them)
-	Deal with scraper failure on the ioby projects
-	Add pagination, only pulling the first page of changebyus (whoops!)
